Small front end app which keeps track of my recipes. Allows me to reference recipes and filter through all recipes.

Also may include some random, and probably useless features just for fun.

React with TypeScript

Update: no longer live but a similar recipe app I built is live at: https://aktivation.space/cookbook/
